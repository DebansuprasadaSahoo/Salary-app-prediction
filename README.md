# Salary-Prediction

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts salary based on various input factors. The backend utilizes a Python script, trained on a machine learning model and saved as a pickle file, to process the input data and generate the predicted salary. The frontend is built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Model: Leverages a trained machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to accurately predict salaries.
Pickle File: The trained model is stored as a pickle file for efficient deployment and reuse.
Streamlit Frontend: A simple yet intuitive web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input relevant data and receive instant salary predictions.
Sklearn Integration: Employs the Scikit-learn library for essential machine learning tasks.
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies (e.g., streamlit, scikit-learn).
Run the Streamlit app using the command streamlit run app.py.
Note: Replace app.py with the actual name of your Streamlit app file.

Additional Information:

Dataset: Describe the dataset used to train the model (if applicable).
Model Architecture: Provide details about the machine learning algorithm and its parameters.
Evaluation Metrics: Mention the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
